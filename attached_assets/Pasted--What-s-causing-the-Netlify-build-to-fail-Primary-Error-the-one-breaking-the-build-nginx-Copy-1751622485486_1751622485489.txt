🧨 What’s causing the Netlify build to fail?
❌ Primary Error (the one breaking the build)
nginx
Copy
Edit
Type error: Property 'firstName' does not exist on type 'User'.
Line:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{getGreeting()}, {user.firstName || user.name}! 👋
This line assumes that user has a property called firstName, but TypeScript says:

"Nope, I don't see firstName in the User type."

✅ What You Can Do to Fix It (2 simple options)
✅ Option 1: Add firstName to the TypeScript User type
Find the file where the User type is defined (usually in types.ts, auth.ts, or lib/types.ts).

Update it like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
export type User = {
  id: string
  email: string
  name?: string
  role?: string
  firstName?: string // 👈 Add this line
}
Now your code:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{getGreeting()}, {user.firstName || user.name}! 👋
will work fine.

✅ Option 2: Use only user.name (temporary quick fix)
If you're not using firstName anywhere else (yet), change this line:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{getGreeting()}, {user.firstName || user.name}! 👋
to:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{getGreeting()}, {user.name}! 👋
It’s a quick way to make the build pass.

⚠️ Side Notes (Other Warnings You Should Fix Soon)
1. 🔄 useAuthStore not exported
csharp
Copy
Edit
'imported as useAuthStore' but not exported from '@/lib/utils'
✅ Solution: Either remove the import if it’s unused or fix it by checking if you defined and exported useAuthStore correctly in lib/utils.ts.

2. 🤖 Type Inference Issues Mean You Should Sync Backend & Frontend
If you're storing user data like firstName, role, etc. in Supabase → make sure that:

Your frontend types reflect all fields you're saving

You’re fetching full user data (not just from Supabase Auth but also from your users table, if that’s where firstName lives)

If firstName is in your database but not in Supabase Auth, you need to:

ts
Copy
Edit
// example fetch to get the full user profile
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', user.id)
  .single()
Then use profile.firstName instead of user.firstName.

🧠 Should Backend Do Anything for This?
No backend change is needed for this particular error. This is frontend only:

You either define the field in your TypeScript types

Or stop using it in your JSX

✅ What You Should Do Right Now
Go to your User type and add firstName?: string.

Re-deploy on Netlify.

If you still get errors, try removing all user.firstName usage and just use user.name.
