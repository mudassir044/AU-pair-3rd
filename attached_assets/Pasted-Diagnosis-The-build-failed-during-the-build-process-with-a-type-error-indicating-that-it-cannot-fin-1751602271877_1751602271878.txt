Diagnosis: The build failed during the build process with a type error indicating that it cannot find the name 'Link' in the file "src/app/documents/page.tsx" line 87.

Solution: The error is likely occurring because the 'Link' component is not imported in the file. To resolve this issue, make sure to import 'Link' from the appropriate package before using it in the file.

In the file "src/app/documents/page.tsx", add the following import statement at the beginning of the file:

import Link from 'next/link';
Make sure to verify that the package containing the 'Link' component is present in the package.json or that the file was committed to the repository before making this modification.
